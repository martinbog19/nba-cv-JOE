6.8300 Advances in Computer Vision - Project
Lucas Leforester & Martin Bogaert

# Abstract

While many NBA statistics aim to estimate player performance, none quantify the spacing provided by players on the court. Here we develop a computer vision approach to infer the position of players from broadcast video using object detection, player classification, and homography projection models. Subsequently, we introduce the adJusted Offensive Elongation metric, quantifying a player's ability to attract defenders. The developed pipeline shows promising results on five different sequences. It produces an average error of 6.4 feet on five known shot locations. Lastly, it finds that proficient shooter Stephen Curry is twice as tightly guarded than forward Draymond Green. This valuable information enables teams to refine their court spacing strategies and scout for valuable shooting specialists.
